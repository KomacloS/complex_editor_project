# Prefilling the Complex Wizard from `buffer.json`

`buffer.json` files generated by `mdb.api` can be loaded directly into the
GUI.  The flow is:

1. `io.buffer_loader.load_complex_from_buffer_json` parses the buffer and
   returns a lightweight `BufferComplex` model without any PinS payload.
2. `io.buffer_loader.to_wizard_prefill` normalizes the data and resolves macro
   IDs before converting it into a `WizardPrefill` structure.
3. `NewComplexWizard.from_wizard_prefill` builds the wizard with all fields
   pre-populated (except for macro parameters).  The wizard opens on the review
   page so the user can immediately inspect the loaded complex.

PinS / macro parameters are intentionally ignored at the moment.  The
`MacroParamProvider` protocol in `parameters.interface` is the extension point
for future integration.  When PinS support is added, the provider will parse
parameter payloads and expose them to the wizard through
`to_wizard_prefill`.
